This lesson provides an exercise-based consolidation of Python, and an introduction [Biopython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython).
It is based on the  [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) workshop paradigm, and is intended to be taught together with the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.
